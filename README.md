#### Second Bayesian ML coursework

Consists of three notebooks.

Notebook a looks at sampling algorithms and implementing of these algorithms.

Noteboook b looks at Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo with No U-Turn sampling, using Numpyro.

Notebook c is mostly code written for the consultancy style component of the coursework, where we used hierarchical models in Numpyro and Jax to estimate a mechanical components likely degradation given a set amount of features and under separate forumlations of degradation. Estimates and graphs used in the report are extracted from this notebook.

First time using Numpyro, Jax.
